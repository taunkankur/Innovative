  <li> <h4>Abstract</h4></li>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;text-align: justify;" >Manually analyzing and identifying bugs related to IVR application that handles 80,000(avg.) calls a day was tiresome and tedious. I had a web based tool to rescue! From plethora of logs, smartly extracting relevant logs both from Flat File and DB, screening it on single web based interface gave production support team at our project a huge relief. This tool also had feature to validate Application post deployment. This tool also had functionality to stage data required for unit testing. I was working to enhance this tool to add a feature of automating unit testing at our project. But, I had to leave the project as I came USA for my Masters.</li>

  <li> <h4>Abstract</h4></li>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;text-align: justify;" >Working on a development project from scratch is an experience with steep learning curve. We had to develop a call center solution for our new client at Australia. We had to provide a web based soft phone to CSR; we used Avaya's API along with JavaScript/CSS to developed a web application. We had developed state-of-the-art solution for reporting statistic about the agent availability w.r.t. agent skills sets; we had developed a windows service that listened to CMS, thereby interpreting the data and storing it to DB. We had developed robust architecture for handling voice call transfer between two different call centers at different geographical location; this was handled effectively by ACD and CTI components. For all the business data transfer we had developed RESTful Web API.</li>

  <li> <h4>Abstract</h4></li>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;text-align: justify;" >The experience of working under agile methodology along with SDLC have seed a belief in me -"A proper process results in a QUALITY software product". My role as a software developer is to develop IVR application using CVP, which demanded thorough understanding of VXML. The IVR so developed was intelligent enough to understand the need of customers calling in. The IVR was categories into check in and check out scenarios, for payment transaction we used PCI tokenization for providing our customer secured payment service. I have also worked on Web Services, JMS, MYSQL, JavaScript as per project requirement. On the course of my work I have proactively developed utility tools for my project, that was used across the team. It was lauded by my client!</li>
